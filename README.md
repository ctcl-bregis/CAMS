# CAMS "Red Rock Crab"

CAMS Asset Management System is a fully custom inventory management software made for mainly organizing computer hardware. I have started to learn how to write Python to start working on the project in late 2021. The idea was from created the need of a specialized asset/inventory management system software to organize the vast amount of computers and computer parts that I had. The idea for using ID numbers and tags for my own hardware has originated in likely 2017 though I have not had a proper system to keep track of assets since then.

CAMS is based off the fully custom-made inventory management software, commonly referred to as just "IMS", used by the computer resale company 2nd Life Inc. of Richmond, Virginia, United States where I was employed formerly. Unlike CAMS, 2nd Life IMS was written using Ruby on Rails. CAMS is also inspired by [PartKeepr](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr) and [GLPI](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi).

Formerly CAMS meant Computer Asset Management System but now CAMS referrs to CAMS Asset Managment System since the software can be used to manage other types of assets if configured so.

Intended Use: CAMS is fully custom to what I need out of an asset management system and may not be suitable for most other applications. 

Starting March 20, 2024, CAMS is to now be written in Rust instead of Python.
