Due to the complexity of CAMS and inventory management in general, development would be split up into phases. A similar plan with phases was done with the NetKart automotive project.

- Phase 1:
  - Read and write basic entry information to the database in a web interface 
  - The database tables and fields are defined by configuration files
- Phase 2:
  - The software is being tested in a real-world environment for personal inventory management
  - Optimizations and fixes while the software is being used
- Phase 3:
  - Start of the optimization of the software to be used by others. Examples: Even more customizibility, Custom logo.
