The documentation feature of CAMS is sort of a rudementary file browser that reads from the "docs" directory in the root of the app.

Currently, it only shows directories or files with an ".md" extension.

Markdown files are rendered automatically

**Idea:** 

- Have metadata files, likely CSV format, store information such as titles for each file in the directory. Instead of hiding a file that is not in such metadata file, it would simply be displayed without the information.
- File editing, edit the markdown documents in the browser.
