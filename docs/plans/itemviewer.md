The New Item and Edit Item are the same except for New Item creating the item.

With very large amounts of options in a select element, for example, Module Brand under Memory Module, Select2 is used to add a search feature to the dropdown menu.
If JavaScript is disabled in the browser, the dropdown menu would act as a regular HTML dropdown. 



Feature Ideas:

- Image upload, automatic resize and display within the Item view
