        <h4>What makes a system unique</h4>
        <p>Due to the modularity of systems such as servers and desktops, which often allow for the CPU, memory and storage devices to be removed, the motherboard is what is defined as the device in CAMS. This also determines the vendor of the device, for example, if a custom-built desktop using a Supermicro board (such as WBPC5B's hardware platform utilizing an X9SRA) is inputted into CAMS, the vendor would be "Supermicro".
