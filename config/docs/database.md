Compared to ContactList, CAMS's database schema is more complex.

## Configuration



## Tables

### User
CAMS was originally meant for use by one user, but the ability to have multiple users is available. 



### Device Types
Each device type (devtype) is given its own table as each device type may have different parameters. 



## Dynamic Tables
When needed, CAMS may gain the ability to dynamically add and remove device types from the web interface. Currently, there are no plans to add this feature. See "features.md".
